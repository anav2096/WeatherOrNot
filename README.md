# WeatherOrNot

This application uses API calls to return weather data for a city selected by the user. A text input of a city name is fed into a fetch function to return pertinent weather data. 
Weather data is displayed in cards across the window. Each search returns current information as well as a 5 day forecast. Search inputs are stored in local memory and displayed for the user. 

The input looks like this:

The 5 day forecast is shown below:
